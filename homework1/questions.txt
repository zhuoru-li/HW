1.Difference between string, stringBuffer, stringBuilder
string is immutable whereas stringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes
StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not. That's why stringBuilder is faster
String concatenation operator + internally uses StringBuffer or StringBuilder class

2.What is volatile and synchronized
Volatile keyword is used to mark a Java variable as “being stored in main memory.” More precisely that means,
that every read of a volatile variable will be read from computer’s main memory, not from CPU cache,
and every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache.

3. Non-blocking data structure: AtomicBoolean, AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicReference
Blocking data structure: BlockingQueue

4. What is immutable?
An object is immutable if its state cannot change after construction. Immutable objects don't expose any way for other objects to
modify their state; the object's fields are initialized only once inside the constructor and never change again

5. Compare and Swap is a technique used when designing concurrent algorithms. Basically, CAS compares an expected value to the concrete value of a variable, and if the concrete value of the variable is equal to the expected value, swaps the value of the variable for a new variable.

6. What are checked exception and unchecked exceptions?
Checked exceptions are forced by compiler and used to indicate exceptional conditions that are out of control of the program,
while unchecked exceptions are occured during runtime and used to indicate programming errors.
